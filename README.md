## Abstract

Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to share their opinions, thoughts and arguments in addition to interacting with the opinions of others. A natural consequence is the emergence of numerous arguments within conversations that become difficult to analyse and understand, especially when there are thousands of users and tweets within those conversations. Techniques such as argumentation have existed for several decades to model and analyse arguments. However, extracting them from natural text is extremely difficult, particularly when applied to social media, where the text is informal and noisy. Argument mining is a new and powerful technique that can solve such an issue.

This thesis addresses this problem by building a software application that models how users interact with a tweet and its argument, both directly and indirectly, by building argumentation models. This uses a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including argument mining, sentiment analysis, argumentation, and building and training ML and DL models. Users can utilise the software system through a web-based user interface (UI) that provides visualisations that require no prior knowledge about any of the specified techniques, ensuring a large target audience. The system is then rigorously tested using various testing and verification techniques to ensure its correctness. Given that no software system exists that solves such a problem and the need for such a solution, this thesis tackles an interesting and practical problem.
